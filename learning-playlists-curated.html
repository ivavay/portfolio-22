        <h2>Overview</h2>
        <p>"Learning Playlists Curated" is web platform for sharing curated learning paths in the community. I worked on 
            this project by myself from April 2021 to June 2021, handling the user research, ideation, and product design. 
        </p>

        <h2>Exploring the Problem Space</h2>
    <p>As a college student who likes to spend my free time learning stuff on the internet, I’m drawn to the space of non-traditional learning for its accessibility in lowering the barrier of entry and its flexibility in self-paced learning. However, with the plethora of resources on the internet, it’s often difficult for people to gauge which resources are the best to start off with, especially if they’re completely new to the topic. I wanted to explore this problem space because I believe that there could be more structured guidance in helping people find the right resources to learn from on the internet.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="shorter">
        <h2>Conducting User Research</h2>
    <p>
        To understand more about the problem space, I asked 3 people within my network whom I know self-learn regularly to answer 10 questions that I had prepared over video calls. The questions ranged from them explaining their rationale in deciding which resource is worth spending their time on to their concerns on self-learning a topic online. Each conversation took about 20-30 minutes and they each yielded fruitful insights. I used Otter AI to audio-record our conversations (with the interviewee’s permission) and transcribe the recording.
    </p>
    </div>
    <div class="shorter">
        <h2>Synthesizing Interviews</h2>
        <p>When I read the interview transcripts, I highlighted quotes that stood out to me and quotes that had mentioned similar insights across multiple interviews.</p>
        <br>
        <p class="highlighted">~ I honestly love sharing learning resources. I feel like if that can be a love language, it would be one of mine.
        <br>~ Because like you might find little bits and pieces of everything online, but it’s hard to like actually fully learn something, because not always is everything like put in one place</p>
        <br>
        <p class="extra-space-above">Then, I came up with a list of key insights based off of the quotes that I had highlighted. Since there were so many, I had to narrow down the key insights to 4 different key problems to focus on and prioritized those that were brought up at least 2 times. I used FigJam to create a mind map of each of the problems and brainstormed design directions for how we could address them.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="images">
        <img class = "medium-image" src="./images/edtech-fig.jpeg" alt=""/>
    </div>
    <div class="shorter">
        <p class="extra-space">
        The insights that I found through this exercise were: <br>
        - Harder to gauge good resources when you’re starting out<br>
        - Credibility of what you’re consuming<br>
        - Not knowing where to go to build a good foundation<br>
        - Learning style depends on your wavelength of mental state for that time
        </p><br>
        <p>Then, I wrote some user stories to guide my sketches and determine concrete call-to-actions in the user flows. With these insights more conceptualized, I was able to go into Figma to create high-fidelity mocks with more confidence.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="shorter">
        <h2>Mocking up Solutions</h2>
        <p class="extra-space-above"> 
            I decided early that this platform would be web-based first since a lot of these resources in the playlists are easier to access on the desktop, especially if you’re learning-by-doing along the way.
        </p>
    </div>
    <div class="images">
        <img class = "medium-image" src="./images/edtech-home.jpeg" alt=""/>
    </div>
    <div class="shorter">
        <p class="extra-space">On the home page, the learner can filter their search results via dropdowns (verified, company, staff’s pick). Creators can become verified if they submit some proof of mastery (such as work experience, certificates, projects built with technology, etc.)in the topics they’re creating a playlist in. This filter addresses the problem of credibilty since it’s not the playlists with the most favorites that are displayed at the top, but the ones that fit with the criteria of the filter.</p>
            <br>
         <p class="extra-space-above" >The learner can also search using the search bar at the top or click on one of the popular topic tags for the month to see playlists created for that topic.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="images">
        <img class = "medium-image" src="./images/learn-react.jpeg" alt=""/>
    <div class="shorter">
        <p class="extra-space">Above is an example of what a playlist looks like. Since playlists are intended to capture the whole spectrum of learning a topic, from beginner to advanced, I wanted to make it easier for learners from different levels to access the appropriate starting points within a playlist. To do this, there is a dropdown filter at the top right corner that indicates beginner, advanced, or advanced.</p>
        <br>
        <p>In addition, there are tags beneath each resource that indicates what format the resource is in (learn-by-doing, video, book, etc.) to help learners choose which learning style is more suitable for them based on their current mental state.</pr>
    </div>
    </div>
    <div class="shorter">
        <h2>Planning Next Steps</h2>
        <p>For the first iteration, I didn’t want to overwhelm myself with too many problems to address. However, there are a few insights from interviews and from informal conversations with friends that I feel like would be nice to develop. For example, maybe the creator can make the playlist public or private if they only want to share the curated resources with people within their network. Also, it would be cool if the playlists can be collaborative so that people within organizations or companies can use the platform to share knowledge with new grad/ junior employees on their teams. To address the social aspect and motivation part of learning in isolation, there could be a gallery for each topic so that learners can see what others have made with the knowledge they’ve gained.</p>
